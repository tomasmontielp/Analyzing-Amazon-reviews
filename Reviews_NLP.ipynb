    "# Retrieving and analyzing E-commerce reviews (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce is a fast-growing business, with the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerating their establishment in the societies. In this sense, companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Best buy, etc., offer millions of products on their website, which can be bought and shipped to your house with a couple of clicks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Customers frequently rate these products (typically from 1 to 5), with the mean review score readily available for the user and seller. Then, the average review score gives a quick indication of how good the customers think the product is. Nevertheless, that number doesn't provide much more insight into why the users are highly/poorly rating the item or what they like (or don't) about the product. This information could be gathered by reading each review, but it would be time-consuming, especially on products with thousands of reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, **the goal of this project** is to develop a tool that automatically retrieves the most frequently used words in positive and negative reviews. This tool will help the seller find the attributes that need improvement and those that have to maintain the quality. On the other hand, the tool can give customers a quick idea of what to watch out for during the free-return days."

    "### Project structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This work will focus on Amazon's reviews on renewed/refurbished iPhones, as renewed smartphones are prone to positive and negative reviews. Specifically, an analysis is made on the iPhone X, XR, and 11 reviews, checking the pros and cons of each product's customer perspective. Then, the benefits and problems developed throughout each product are presented. Lastly, all the reviews are merged, and a sentiment analysis model is developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the project was split into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part I**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploring amazon website to retrieve the desired reviews into databases, employing BeautifulSoup as a web scraper, together with Docker and Splash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part II**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean, organize, and analyze the reviews, drawing conclusions from the most frequently used words in positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "* Develop a sentiment analysis tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The script \"reviews_scraper.py\" for obtaining the reviews (Part I) is available at:\n",
    "\n",

Second thing that you need to keep in mind Is the battery capacity if you’re looking for a phone you want to try to aim for 95% battery capacity is your best bet when I received mine I got it at 80% battery capacity so that’s also another thing to keep in mind when you’re buying a used phone make sure you’re looking at that battery capacity it’s really important another thing you will receive scratches on the display and the back glass in my opinion this is nothing to cry over just throw a case on it and it should look pretty good. you also want to make sure that your face recognition is on point make sure that everything on the phone is responsive after Unboxing thank you guys so much for taking your time in reading this long message hopefully you bought your product and enjoyed it.

    "The bag-of-words approach is a simple and commonly used way to represent text in machine learning, which ignores structure and only counts how often each word occurs. CountVectorizer allows us to use the bag-of-words approach by converting a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we instantiate the CountVectorizer and fit it into our training data. Fitting the CountVectorizer consists of the tokenization of the trained data and the building of the vocabulary. It does so by finding all sequences of characters of at least two letters or numbers separated by word boundaries, then converting everything to lowercase (we already lowercased the text) and builds a vocabulary using these tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set the minimum word occurrence to 10 (min_df) for it to be taken into account, to remove words that appear in only a few reviews and might not be good predictors. Additionally, we'll set the n-gram range from 2 to 3 to add context to the repeated words. \n",
