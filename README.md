# Analyzing-Amazon-reviews

E-commerce is a fast-growing business, with the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerating their establishment in the societies. In this sense, companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Best buy, etc., offer millions of products on their website, which can be bought and shipped to your house with a couple of clicks. 

Customers frequently rate these products (typically from 1 to 5), with the mean review score readily available for the user and seller. Then, the average review score gives a quick indication of how good the customers think the product is. Nevertheless, that number doesn't provide much more insight into why the users are highly/poorly rating the item or what they like (or don't) about the product. 

This information could be gathered by reading each review, but it would be time-consuming, especially on products with thousands of reviews. Thus, **the goal of this project** is to develop a tool that automatically retrieves the most frequently used words in positive and negative reviews. This tool will help the seller find the attributes that need improvement and those that have to maintain the quality. On the other hand, the tool can give customers a quick idea of what to watch out for during the free-return days.
